          <h2>About the Project</h2>
		<h3>The Archive</h3>
		<p>The Columbia University Human Rights Web Archive and Portal provides search access to snapshots of over 350 web sites in the area of human rights.</p>
		<p>There are currently over 7 million pages of Web content in 8 languages, and cover a broad range of human rights issues, such as women's rights, genocide, refugees, war crimes, reconciliation, AIDS, civil rights, democracy, gun control, human trafficking, and many others.</p>

		<h3>The Purpose</h3>
		<p>An initiative of CUL's Center for Human Rights Documentation and Research, the Human Rights Web Archive is an effort to preserve and ensure access to freely available human rights resources created mainly by non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, and individuals.</p>
		<p>The project's objective is to develop best practices and standards for collecting and preserving freely available web resources and to integrate this activity into existing library collection development and technical services programs. </p>
		<p>The proliferation of freely available Internet resources of high research value has far outpaced libraries' efforts to collect and preserve them, forcing our collection development models to evolve. With the benefit of continued support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Columbia University Libraries and Information Services (CUL) has in 2009 begun a three-year project on Web Resources Collection Program Development (following a 2008 pilot project).</p>

          <h3>Grant Supports Innovative Web Archiving Program at Columbia Libraries</h3>
		<p>Columbia University Libraries will soon begin an archive of human rights content published on the Web. The Libraries has received a three-year, $716,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to develop and implement a program that will establish best practices for collecting, managing, preserving and providing access to at-risk digital content on human rights.</p>

		<p>Web-based human rights information is in danger of disappearing into the ether. Sites posting reports and news, particularly those listing human rights abuses, are often administered by organizations or individuals lacking the resources to maintain them, and are commonly hacked or taken down by opposition groups.</p>

	  <h3>Columbia University Libraries Receives $716K Mellon Grant for Web Content Collection and Archiving</h3>
		<p>(NEW YORK, June 25, 2009) Columbia University Libraries has received a $716,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to develop and implement a program for incorporating web content into the Librariesâ€™ collections.</p>
<p>Building on the results of a planning grant completed in 2008, the new three-year Mellon Foundation grant will establish best practices for collecting, managing, preserving, and providing access to at-risk digital content, specifically in the area of human rights. This is particularly timely, given events in world areas like Tibet and Iran, where web content is so vulnerable.</p>

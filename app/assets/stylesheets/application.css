 * Required by Blacklight:

 * This is the default theme. You can modify many of the settings
 * by editing your local app/assets/stylesheets/blacklight_themes/standard.css
 * removed: = require 'blacklight_themes/standard'
 *
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Using require_self below to make sure that the items below it are included in
 * the specified order (or at least that's what I think it does)
 * = require_self
